# TeaAndCoffeeeMachine

The project is designed to give a readout to a customer of there drink being made when they select one.

The following is the spec:

Lemon Tea

Boil some water
Steep the water in the tea
Pour tea in the cup
Add lemon

Coffee

Boil some water
Brew the coffee grounds
Pour coffee in the cup
Add sugar and milk

Chocolate

Boil some water
Add drinking chocolate powder to the water
Pour chocolate in the cup


Create a web application to perform this task.
Based on the selection by the customer the application needs only to provide a readout on the actions performed during the preparation of the drink.

This has been split into a few pages to give a more website like experience, the page which actually performs the program is /Machine. All the other pages are just for flavour.
